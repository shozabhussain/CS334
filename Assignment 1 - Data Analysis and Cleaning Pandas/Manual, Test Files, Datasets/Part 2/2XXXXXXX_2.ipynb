    "The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. The titanic dataset is a record of passengers aboard the Titanic and their fates (whether or not they survived the incident). The principal source for data about Titanic passengers is the Encyclopedia Titanica. The datasets used here were begun by a variety of researchers. One of the original sources is Eaton & Haas (1994) Titanic: Triumph and Tragedy, Patrick Stephens Ltd, which includes a passenger list created by many researchers and edited by Michael A. Findlay.\n",

    "- Read the answering guidelines carefully. Be careful about what your final answer should contain.  \n",
    "- Some useful functions that you might need for this assignment are groupby(), unique(), copy(), count(), sum(), zip(), list() \n",
    "- Variables named like *_df always store a dataframe.\n",
    "- Use the autograder to verify your code but keep in mind that there are some **hidden test cases** as well. Your code should work for types of testcases. If your code works for the testcases given to you but fails to work for the hidden test cases, no credit will be given for the particular question. Do not hardcode any values. "
