Therefore, apart from the ```furnishingstatus``` column, convert all qualitative columns to a one-hot encoding. The ```furnishingstatus``` column has three classes, all of which would need to be converted into a one-hot encoding. Use ```.get_dummies``` function in the pandas library to convert variables like ```furnishingstatus``` based on the different categories present. \n",
